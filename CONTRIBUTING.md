# Drake ROS: Contributing

## Code Style

All code in this repository should generally comply with Drake's [code style
guide](https://drake.mit.edu/code_style_guide.html).

## Continuous Integration

This repository uses GitHub Actions to perform CI.

If you are prototyping a PR, consider saving resources by disabling CI by
adding the `status: defer ci` label to your PR.

If you add or remove the label to an existing PR, you must ensure that checks
are re-run with job conditions being re-evaluated. You can do this by pushing
new changes (ideal) or closing and reopening the PR.

**Note**: Manually re-running the checks for the PR does not seem to
re-evaluate label-based conditions; i.e., in the PR, go to "Checks", click
"Re-run all jobs". If you have just removed the label, it will still run the
jobs as though they were skipped.
