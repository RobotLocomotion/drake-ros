# Drake ROS

[![drake-ros continuous integration](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## About

The repository contains experimental code to interface ROS2 with Drake (and
Bazel).
Prototype work is happening on the
[`develop` branch](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros/tree/develop),
but please excercise caution if you are attempting to use this code.
Both the functionality and APIs on the `develop` branch are likely to change
regularly.

The intended function of this repository:
 - API to utilize ROS from a Drake program
 - Examples of how to use both Drake and ROS together
