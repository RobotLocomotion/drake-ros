"""
Generates a C++ shim that can inject runtime environment information for
C/C++ binaries that have such requirements. Using a C++ shim for C++ binaries
simplifies UX during debugging sessions, as fork-follow behavior in common
debuggers like gdb and lldb makes it transparent.

This shim uses a sentinel environment variable so that it only modifies the
environment once. Any nested shims will use the top-level shim's environment.

See do_dload_shim() documentation for further reference.
