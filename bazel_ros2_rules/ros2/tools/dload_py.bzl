Generates a Python shim that can inject runtime environment information for
Python binaries that have such requirements. Using a Python shim for Python
binaries enables downstream usage of the latter through transitive
dependencies.

This shim uses a sentinel environment variable so that it only modifies the
environment once. Any nested shims will use the top-level shim's environment.

See do_dload_shim() documentation for further reference.
