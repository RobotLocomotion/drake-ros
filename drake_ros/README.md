# Drake ROS Core

This package provides abstractions to simplify the use of core ROS2 functionality from within Drake.

It introduces ROS2 equivalents of `LcmInterfaceSystem`, `LcmPublisherSystem`, `LcmSubscriberSystem` systems in Drake.
It is similar to this ROS1 prototype [`gizatt/drake_ros_systems`](https://github.com/gizatt/drake_ros_systems).

Please see subdirectories for more details.

## Building

For an example of using `colcon`, please see root-level `drake_ros_examples`.
