        env_changes: runtime environment changes to be applied, as a mapping from
          environment variable names to actions to be performed on them.
          Actions are (action_type, action_args) tuples. Supported action types
          are: 'path-prepend', 'path-replace', and 'replace'. Paths are resolved
          relative to the runfiles directory of the downstream executable.
