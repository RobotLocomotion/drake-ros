# Drake ROS Examples

This is a collection of examples built around `drake_ros` libraries' C++ and
Python APIs.

## Building

This package has been built and tested on Ubuntu Focal with ROS Rolling, using a
Drake nightly or any stable releases after 14 Jan 2022.
It may work on other versions of ROS and Drake, but it hasn't been tested.

To build it:

1. [Install ROS Rolling](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Rolling/)
1. Source your ROS installation `. /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash`
1. [Download Drake binary](https://drake.mit.edu/from_binary.html), nightly or
any stable releases after 14 Jan 2022.
1. Extract the Drake binary installation, install it's prerequisites, and
[use this Python virutalenv trick](https://drake.mit.edu/from_binary.html).
1. Activate the drake virtual environment.
1. Build it using Colcon.
    
    **Colcon**
    1. Make a workspace `mkdir -p ./ws/src`
    1. `cd ./ws/src`
    1. Get the code `git clone https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros.git`
    1. `cd ..`
    1. Build this package `colcon build --packages-up-to drake_ros_examples`
    
## Running

Source your workspace.

```
. ./ws/install/setup.bash
# Also make sure to activate drake virtual environment
```

  Now you can run C++ and Python examples using `ros2 run drake_ros_examples
  <example-executable-or-script>`.

## List of examples

- [RS flip flop](./examples/rs_flip_flop): a latch with a ROS 2 topic interface.
- [IIWA manipulator](./examples/iiwa_manipulator): an RViz visualization of a
static IIWA arm.
- [Multiple robots](./examples/multirobot): an RViz visualization of an array of
Kuka LBR iiwa manipulators.
- [UFO](./examples/multirobot): an RViz visualization of a flying object
controlled with the Drake systems framework and commanded using RViz.
